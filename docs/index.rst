GLANCE TOOLS
==================================

This is the documentation to use the apps and tools created for the GLANCE
project at the Department of Earth and Environment, Boston University.

.. _Google Earth Engine: https://earthengine.google.com/

This toolbox provides applications and a Javascript API for performing all 
the workflows used for the generation of global land cover maps using CCDC
results, including:

* Visualizing pixel-based time series and CCDC model fits
* Performing change detection for entire study regions
* Viewing CCDC coefficient images
* Producing "synthetic" imagery
* Land cover classification
* Creating maps of land cover/use change
* Collecting reference data


This documentation and the tools are a work in progress. This documentation is
intended only for members of GLANCE project, including our international 
collaborators.For any questions contact us at: parevalo@bu.edu or bullocke@bu.edu.
